1.Explain how to run it
First install python,and add it in the environment.
Second, run the CreateHtml.py. Make sure that pyh.py is in the same catalog with the CreateHtml.py file.
About how to install python and how to run the python files, you can ask the internet.

2.How to change the python file to finish your own HTML
this python file is very to understand.
I use the python os to get the current time. and use caseConfig.sections() to read the XXX.ini file. 
Use some keyword to definition the table style.
Make two color to make result more pithy. 
"
aTLog = "ATLog/"+thisCase+".txt"
traceLog = "MIDletTrace/"+thisCase+".txt"
"
Those two can open txt file in html to show the result detail. You can change it to suit yourself. About this function, I
didn't change the code to make it possible but only change the path to make it right can open file in HTML.
